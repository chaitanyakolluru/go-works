`simple json app`

`The idea behind this app is simple, it creates a new data.json file in current working directory, and starts exposing APIs to perform CRUD operations on the created json file.

Below is the schema of the json data:`

`{
  "id": "int",
  "name": "string",
  "age": "int",
  "designation": "string",
  "location": "string",
  "todos": ["string"]
}
`
